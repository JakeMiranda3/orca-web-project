<h1> Orcas in the Ecosystem</h1> <!-- Orcas in ecosystem header -->
<!-- Orcas in the Ecosystem paragraph-->
<p> Orcas live in various marine ecosystems but they prefer cooler temperatures and polar regions. 
	Orcas are apex predators and play a crucial role in their ecosystems. They balance the marine
	 food webs in numerous ways. Since orcas are apex predators they help regulate prey 
	populations and prevent the overpopulation of certains species. Unfortunately there's been a 
	decline in their population. Looking specifically at the Southern Resident orcas, which 
	primarily inhabit the coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest, have seen a decline from a 
	peak of 98 in 1995 to 73 in 2024. This significant decline led to this population being listed
	 as federally endangered.

<h1> Threats to Orcas</h1> <!-- Threats to Orcas header -->
<details>
 <summary> Pollution </summary>
 <p> Orcas are affected by pollution through the accumulation of toxic chemicals 
	in their bodies and ingestion of plastic and marine debris.</p>
</details>
<details> 
 <summary> Decline in Food Supply </summary>
 <p> The decline in food supply threatens orcas survival by leading to 
	malnutrition and reduced reproductive success. </p>
</details>
<details>
 <summary> Climate Change </summary>
 <p> Climate change affects orcas by altering ocean temperatures and ecosystems, 
	which can disrupt their food sources and migration patterns. </p>
</details>
<details> 
 <summary> Entanglement </summary>
 <p> Entanglement in fishing gear and other debris can cause serious injuries 
	or even death for orcas, making it a significant threat to their survival. </p>
