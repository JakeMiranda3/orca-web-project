<h1>Carbon FootPrint</h1> <!-- Carbon FootPrint header -->
<!-- Carbon Footprint paragraph-->
<p> A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, such as C02, released into the atmosphere 
	by either a person, company, or activity, which contributes to climate change. You can get involved without 
	absolutely turning your life upside down, by simply being more considerate of energy and gas usage. Not to imply 
	that you need to walk everywhere you go, but it can be as simple as turning off unused electronics. Another great 
	thing to do is to recycle and use reusable bags and bottles. Not only does getting rid of plastic usage help you by 
	not digesting microplastic, but it also helps the environment. A large carbon footprint results in more contribution 
	to climate change, which can harm ecosystems by increasing global temperatures and disrupting wildlife habitats.
